# Linux Runtime

These are the latest steps for installing ENLIGHTEN on Linux.

The following process was tested from fresh Ubuntu VMs (18 LTS and 22.04 LTS tested) running under Parallels 19.3.0 on MacOS 14.4.1.

1. Open a terminal. (Ctrl+Alt+T)

2. Download the install script.

```bash
wget wasatchphotonics.com/binaries/apps/enlighten/enlighten_ubuntu_launcher.sh
```

3. Mark it for execution

```bash
chmod +x enlighten_ubuntu_launcher.sh
```

4. Run it

```bash
./enlighten_ubuntu_launcher
```

5. Follow on-screen prompts. You may be prompted to enter your password to enable "sudo" privileges.
