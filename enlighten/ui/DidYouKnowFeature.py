            <p>ASTM E1840-96 (2014) specifies a procedure for daily, or even hourly

               of eight approved reference samples, whose Raman peaks are measured
               and compared to expected locations. Any deltas are averaged together
               to create a temporary (session) offset to the wavenumber axis, improving
               accuracy of Raman peak locations in graphed and saved data.</p>

               optionally visualize the "expected" Raman peaks on the graph to compare
               against the measured spectrum, and to see which sample peaks are used
               in the correction. The computed offset is briefly displayed on-screen,

                intensity (y-axis) on Raman spectra. This is sometimes just

            <p>Raman Intensity Correction is one of the most important steps you can

               href="https://wasatchphotonics.com/technologies/reproducible-raman-measurements/">Tech
               Note"</a> on repeatable Raman measurements.</p>
             <p>ENLIGHTENâ„¢ only allows you enable Raman Intensity Correction when
                in Raman or Expert mode, as it is only applicable to Raman spectra.
                Raman Intensity Correction also requires a dark spectrum to be stored.
                Therefore, when Raman Intensity Correction is enabled, you cannot
                clear your dark; you must first disable Raman Intensity Correction
                before clearing and refreshing your dark, then re-enabling it after.</p>
             <p>Finally, Raman Intensity Correction requires that the horizontal
                ROI be enabled. This is because NIST SRM standards are only certified
                within a given spectral range, and it would be invalid to extrapolate
                the correction factors outside the configured ROI.</p>
             <p>As a simple visual "sanity-check" of the correction factors generated
                from the SRM calibration coefficients, you can enable a normalized 
                graph trace indicating how the calibration changes over the detector.
                Typically, this will resemble a "U"-shaped parabola, with higher
                scaling factors at the edges of the detector, and curving lower
