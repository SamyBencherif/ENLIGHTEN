# ENLIGHTEN README

**ENLIGHTEN&trade;** (the registered [trademark](https://trademarks.justia.com/873/08/enlighten-87308319.html)
is in all-caps) is Wasatch Photonics' standard desktop GUI tool for controlling 
spectrometers, reading and graphing spectra, and performing basic analytic and 
utility tasks.

It is _not_ an advanced production or manufacturing platform for assembly,
alignment, focus, QC etc -- see RamanSpecCal for those functions.

It is also not an end-all / be-all "perform everything you might ever want to
do with a spectrometer" tool -- if we were to invest in creating that, we 
probably wouldn't give it away for free.  (But give 
[Spectragryph](https://www.effemm2.de/spectragryph/) or 
[Panorama](https://www.labcognition.com/en/panorama.html) a try!)

ENLIGHTEN is committed to providing convenient graphical desktop support for
accessing, testing and controlling the most common functions supported by 
Wasatch Photonics spectrometers.  Some higher-level aggregate / analytic 
functions are left for customers or 3rd-party tools to provide, and our
[plug-in architecture](README_PLUGINS.md) makes it simple for users to
extend ENLIGHTEN in countless ways we never imagined.
